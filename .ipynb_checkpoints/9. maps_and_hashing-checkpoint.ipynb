Stacks and Queues for the head objects do look-ups in constant time. Priority queues do so in constant time for the element with the top priority, but any other element is found in linear-time search. The ability to do constant-time look-ups will make almost any algorithm instantly faster."

    "* We can also keep the original hash function, but change the structure of the array. So, instead of storing one hash value in each slot, we can store a list that contains all values hashed at that spot. These lists are generally called **`Buckets`**.\n",

    "The purpose of a load factor is to give us a sense of how \"full\" a hash table is. For example, if we're trying to store 10 values in a hash table with 1000 buckets, the load factor would be 0.01, and the majority of buckets in the table will be empty. We end up wasting memory by having so many empty buckets, so we may want to rehash, or come up with a new hash function with less buckets. We can use our load factor as an indicator for when to rehashâ€” **as the load factor approaches 0, the more empty, or sparse, our hash table is**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, the closer our load factor is to 1 (meaning the number of values equals the number of buckets), the better it would be for us to rehash and add more buckets. **Any table with a load value greater than 1 is guaranteed to have collisions**."

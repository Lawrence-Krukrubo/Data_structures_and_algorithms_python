    "A graph is a data-structure designed to show relationships between objects. the purpose of a graph is to show how different things are connected to one another. it's also sometimes called a network. A graph is similar to a tree in many ways.\n",
    "* Graphs also contain `Nodes` or `Vertices` and connections between nodes also called `edges`.\n",
    "* Infact, a tree is just a more specific type of graph. It's just like a binary-tree is a type of tree and a BST is a type of binary-tree.\n",
    "* In graphs, cycles are allowed. This means we can start at any node and chart a path right back to the start node. This implies that unlike trees, graphs don't really have a root-node.\n",
    "* Graphs are really vaguely defined. this is so all different use cases of graphs are accommodated.\n",
    "* It's common to think that nodes are the parts of graphs that store data and edges are merely connections between nodes. But in reality, edges can also store data. Edges often contain data about the strength of a connection between nodes.\n",

    "* If we make a round trip and travel through the same two nodes going in opposite directions, we might have two edges between the same 2 nodes, one representing each direction we're travelling.\n",
    "* An **`Undirected-Graph`** has edges with no sense of direction.\n",
    "* Graphs permit cycles, while trees do not. Cycles in a graph are quite dangerous in implementation. They can result in infinite loops. Thus one needs a way to keep track of visited nodes in a graph to avoid this issue.\n",

    "A directed graph is weakly connected when only replacing all of the directed edges with undirected edges can cause it to be connected. Imagine that your graph has several vertices with one outbound edge, meaning an edge that points from it to some other vertex in the graph. There's no way to reach all of those vertices from any other vertex in the graph, but if those edges were changed to be undirected all vertices would be easily accessible.\n",

    "### Graph Representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be functionally the same but built in a handful of different ways. For example using OOP, vertex (nodes) and edge objects can be created and given properties like name, value, ID, a list of edges it's connected to and so on just as we did with Trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, operations that traverse graphs can be more inconvenient if we need to search through vertex and edge objects. There are several ways of representing connections on simple graphs that only use lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edge Lists:** An edge-list is simply a list of edges. The edges themselves are represented as a list of just two elements each, the ID number of the `from` node and that of the `to` node. Thus the edge-list is a list of lists or a 2D list, where each sub-list is a list of only 2 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjacency List:** In an Adjacency-list, our vertices or Nodes,                                                                                                                            normally have an ID number that corresponds to the index in an array. While in the array, each space is used to store a list of nodes that the nodes with that ID is adjacent to. Also the adjacency list is 2D as it's a list that contains other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adjacency Matrix:** Lastly, an adjacency matrix can be used. A matrix is essentially a 2D array and the lists inside are all the same length. A matrix can also be called a rectangular-array. The adjacency matrix is quite similar to the adjacency array. The indices in the outer array still represent nodes with those IDs, and the lists inside still represent which nodes are adjacent. Although this is done slightly different in exactly One-Hot-Encoding style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which method of representation we use depends on what makes the most sense for us and what operations we'd be performing most often. If we're looking at Node-degree, the adjacency-list will probably be the fastest."

    "###  DFS in Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike a `Tree`, there's no root in a graph, so no obvious place to start. We can begin with any `node`. First, mark the `node` selected as **`seen`**. A common implementation of DFS is a **Stack (LIFO)**. So we can store the `node` we just saw on a Stack. Next, we pick an `edge`, follow it and mark the next `node` as **`seen`** and add it to the Stack. We continue like this for all edges and nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we hit a node that has been previously seen before, just go back to the previous node and try another edge. If we run out of edges with new nodes, we pop the current node from the stack and go back to the one before it, which is just the next one on the Stack. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We continue step 2 above until we've popped everything off the Stack or we've found the node we were originally looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "* However, here we search every edge of one node before continuing to another node. We start with the first node and mark it as seen, then visit the node adjacent to it and once we mark that node, we can add it to a **Queue (FIFO)**. Then we go back to that first node and visit every thing adjacent to it, marking each as seen and adding it to the Queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we've run out of edges, we can just DEqueue a node from the Queue and use that as our next starting point. Then we look at evrery node adjacent to that one adding each one to the Queue until we've exhausted our options.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Note that, when we Dequeue, we're getting a node adjacent to the last node we just saw.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

We need to continue adding nodes one level at a time. We finish off one level entirely before moving unto the next.\n",

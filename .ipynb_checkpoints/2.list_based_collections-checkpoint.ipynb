However, inserting into an array is O(n), since you may need to shift elements to make space for the one you're inserting, or even copy everything to a new array if you run out of space. Thus, inserting into a Python list is actually O(n), while operations that search for an element at a particular spot are O(1)\n",

    "A linked-list is an extension of a list, but it's definitely not an array\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some elements have an order, but there are no indices like an array.\n",
    "* Instead a linked-list is characterized by its links.\n",
    "* Each element has some notion what the next element is, since it's connected to it, but not necessarily how long the list is or where it is in the list.\n",
    "* An array is different in that each element has it's fixed index in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Ever Use a Linked-List?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No doubt an array gives more information about its elements and seems to provide more structure. But inserting and deleting items from an array can be messy and expensive especially items at the start of an array. On the flip-side, adding and removing items from a linked-list are soo easy in comparison to an array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In higher level programming languages like python, there is no visible difference between an array and a linked-list. There's just a list that does both. However questions about arrays and linked-lists are fairly common in technical interviews, so it helps to know the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Differences between Arrays and Linked-list**\n",
    "* The main distinction is that each element stores different information\n",
    "* In both cases a single element will store a value\n",
    "* in an array we have an index for each element that can be queried or indexed directly\n",
    "* In a Linked-list, we store a reference to the next element in the list. in many languages this will look like assigning the actual `next element` as a property of the current element.\n",
    "* Way down at the hardware level of a Linked-List, each element actually stores the memory address of the next element all the way from left to right. The final element stores no memory address since there's no element after it.\n",
    "* It's pretty easy to delete and insert elements in a Linked-List\n",
    "* Adding an element in a Linked-List will look like simply changing the `next reference` of the current element to point to a new object and we're done! The one thing to remember is to assign the `next reference` of the new object before assigning the `next reference` of the current object to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that insertion in the Linked-List takes constant time $O(1)$ since we're just inserting elements and not shifting around all objects like in an array. Deletions take the same basic steps like insertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doubly Linked-List:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are simply linked lists with references to both next and previous elements. Meaning we can traverse the Linked-list in both directions. The most important thing is to be careful not to lose references, when adding or removing elements."

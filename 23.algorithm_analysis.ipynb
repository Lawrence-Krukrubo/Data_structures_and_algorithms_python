    "In order to answer this question, we need to remember that there is an important difference between a program and the underlying algorithm that the program is representing. <br>**An algorithm** is a generic, step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem. It is a method for solving any instance of the problem such that given a particular input, the algorithm produces the desired result. <br>**A program**, on the other hand, is an algorithm that has been encoded into some programming language. There may be many programs for the same algorithm, depending on the programmer and the programming language being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm analysis** is concerned with comparing algorithms based upon the amount of computing resources that each algorithm uses. We want to be able to consider two algorithms and say that one is better than the other because it is more efficient in its use of those resources or perhaps because it simply uses fewer."

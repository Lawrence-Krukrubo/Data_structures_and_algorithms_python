    "\n",
    "The over all idea of a merge-sort is to split a huge array down as much as possible. And over time, build it back up doing a set of comparisons and sortings at each step along the way. \n",
    "* The general idea of breaking up an array, sorting all the parts of it and then building it back up again is called **`Divide-and-Conquer`**\n",
    "* In merge sort, worst case we're doing roughly $n$ comparisons for $log(n)$ steps. It's actually $log(n)$ + 1 but due to the approximation of `BigOh Notation` we don't care much about when it happens and only care about the interval at which it happens.\n",
    "* This makes an over all worst case of $O(nlog(n))$\n",
    "* So, Merge-sort time complexity of $O(nlog(n))$ is much better than the $O(n^2)$ time complexity we got for Bubble-sort.\n",
    "* However, the space efficiency of Merge-sort is much worse than Bubble sorts's $O(1)$. In Bubble sort, we sorted In-place at constant space. While in Merge-sort we always needed an additional array and assuming we deleted arrays after using them, the space complexity for Merge-sort is $O(n)$"

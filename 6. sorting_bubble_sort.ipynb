    "\n",
    "Bubble sort or sinking sort is a naive approach. Here we go through an array comparing elements side-by-side and switching them whenever necessary. At each iteration, the biggest element floats to the top so to speak.\n",
    "* In Bubble sort, we iterate through the array $n-1$ times $n$ iterations and at each step we did $n-1$ comparisons.\n",
    "* So $n-1$ comparisons for $n-1$ iterations is $(n-1)(n-1)$. Which has an overall worst case of $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "* There is a tactic to speed-up Bubble sort by not iterating on already sorted elements in subsequent iterations. But it still has the over all worst case of $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "* So for a Bubble-sort, the worst case and average case are equally $O(n^2)$, while the best case is $O(n)$, which holds true on the assumption that the array is already sorted before we did the Bubble-sort. Or if len(array) == 1.\n",
    "* One last thing, we don't have to add any extra data structure or memory device to do Bubble-sort. Thus, it's a perfect example of In-Place Sorting algorithm. This means though it's time complexity is $O(n^2)$, it's space complexity is $O(1)$, constant."

    "Recursion is perhaps one of the most confusing topics in computer science. The idea here is to create a function that calls itself\n",
    "* First of all, a recursive function needs to call itself at some point\n",
    "* Second, a recursive function needs a base case\n",
    "* We can think of a recursive-function sort of like a while-loop in some regards.\n",
    "* The base-case is like the exit condition that lets us know when the recursive function stops, otherwise, it'll call itself forever - (Infinite Recursion).\n",
    "* A recursive function also needs to alter the input parameter at some point. Otherwise we'd never know when to stop if the input parameter is not altered based on some order."
